    This page was created by Michael Cebrian as part of a Grand Challenges course at Villanova.
  </p>
  <p>
    For this course I researched Angular and documented many of the websites which helped me on my journey. My goal was to
    help others learn Angular by outlining the key parts of creating Angular applications and providing a curated list of
    resources for learning each part.

    For those looking to learn Angular, I hope this site helps you on your journey!
